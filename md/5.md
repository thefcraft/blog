# 1. Introduction to Python

Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. It emphasizes code readability and allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than possible in languages such as C++ or Java. Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.

### Why Learn Python?

- **Easy to Learn and Use:** Python's syntax is simple and resembles English, making it easy for beginners to learn.
- **Versatile:** Python can be used for web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and more.
- **Strong Community Support:** Python has a large and active community that contributes to a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks.
- **In-Demand Skill:** Python is widely used in industry, and proficiency in Python can open doors to numerous job opportunities.

# 2. Setting Up Your Environment

Before diving into Python programming, you'll need to set up your development environment. Here's how to get started:

### Installing Python

1. **Download Python:**
   - Visit the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/) and download the latest version of Python.

2. **Install Python:**
   - Follow the instructions for your operating system to install Python. Be sure to check the option to add Python to your system's PATH during the installation process.

### Setting Up a Code Editor

A good code editor can enhance your coding experience. Here are some popular choices:

- **VS Code:** A lightweight and powerful editor with extensive support for Python.
- **PyCharm:** A dedicated Python IDE with many features for professional developers.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** An interactive environment great for data analysis and scientific computing.

# 3. Python Basics

Let's start with the fundamentals of Python programming.

### Variables and Data Types

In Python, you don't need to declare the type of a variable. Python determines the type based on the value assigned.

```python
# Variables and Data Types
name = "Alice"  # String
age = 30       # Integer
height = 5.5   # Float
is_student = True  # Boolean
```

### Operators

Python supports various operators for arithmetic, comparison, logical, and bitwise operations.

```python
# Arithmetic Operators
a = 10
b = 5
print(a + b)  # Addition
print(a - b)  # Subtraction
print(a * b)  # Multiplication
print(a / b)  # Division

# Comparison Operators
print(a == b)  # Equal to
print(a != b)  # Not equal to
print(a > b)   # Greater than
print(a < b)   # Less than

# Logical Operators
print(a > 0 and b > 0)  # Logical AND
print(a > 0 or b > 0)   # Logical OR
print(not(a > 0))       # Logical NOT
```

### Control Structures

Python provides several control structures for decision-making and looping.

#### If-Else Statements

```python
# If-Else Statements
num = 10
if num > 0:
    print("Positive number")
else:
    print("Non-positive number")
```

#### For Loops

```python
# For Loop
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```

#### While Loops

```python
# While Loop
i = 0
while i < 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1
```

---

# 4. Functions and Modules

Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task.

### Defining Functions

```python
# Function Definition
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

# Function Call
print(greet("Alice"))
```

### Using Modules

Modules are files containing Python code that can be imported and used in other Python files.

```python
# Importing a Module
import math

print(math.sqrt(16))  # Using a function from the math module
```

---

# 5. Working with Data Structures

Python offers several built-in data structures to manage collections of data.

### Lists

Lists are ordered, mutable collections of items.

```python
# Lists
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
fruits.append("date")  # Adding an item
print(fruits)
```

### Tuples

Tuples are ordered, immutable collections of items.

```python
# Tuples
coordinates = (10, 20)
print(coordinates)
```

### Dictionaries

Dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value pairs.

```python
# Dictionaries
student = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25, "grade": "A"}
print(student["name"])
```

### Sets

Sets are unordered collections of unique items.

```python
# Sets
unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
unique_numbers.add(6)
print(unique_numbers)
```

---

# 6. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python

OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects," which are instances of classes.

### Defining a Class

```python
# Class Definition
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def bark(self):
        return f"{self.name} says woof!"

# Creating an Object
my_dog = Dog("Buddy", 3)
print(my_dog.bark())
```

---

# 7. File Handling

Python provides functions to read from and write to files.

### Reading from a File

```python
# Reading from a File
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
```

### Writing to a File

```python
# Writing to a File
with open("example.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Hello, World!")
```

---

# 8. Error and Exception Handling

Handling errors and exceptions is crucial for writing robust programs.

### Try-Except Block

```python
# Try-Except Block
try:
    result = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero!")
```

---

# 9. Working with Libraries

Python has a vast ecosystem of libraries for various tasks.

### NumPy

NumPy is a library for numerical computations.

```python
# NumPy Example
import numpy as np

array = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
print(array)
```

### Pandas

Pandas is a library for data manipulation and analysis.

```python
# Pandas Example
import pandas as pd

data = {"Name": ["Alice", "Bob"], "Age": [25, 30]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df)
```

---

# 10. Building a Simple Project

Let's build a simple project to reinforce what we've learned. We'll create a basic contact management system.

### Contact Management System

```python
# Contact Management System
class Contact:
    def __init__(self, name, phone):
        self.name = name
        self.phone = phone

    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.name}: {self.phone}"

class ContactManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.contacts = []

    def add_contact(self, name, phone):
        new_contact = Contact(name, phone)
        self.contacts.append(new_contact)

    def display_contacts(self):
        for contact in self.contacts:
            print(contact)

# Main Program
manager = ContactManager()
manager.add_contact("Alice", "123-456-7890")
manager.add_contact("Bob", "987-654-3210")
manager.display_contacts()
```

# 11. Advanced Topics

Let's delve into some advanced Python topics that can enhance your programming skills.

### Decorators

Decorators are a way to modify the behavior of functions or classes.

```python
# Decorator Example
def my_decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Something is happening before the function is called.")
        func()
        print("Something is happening after the function is called.")
    return wrapper

@my_decorator
def say_hello():
    print("Hello!")

say_hello()
```

### Generators

Generators are a way to create iterators using

 the `yield` keyword.

```python
# Generator Example
def my_generator():
    yield 1
    yield 2
    yield 3

for value in my_generator():
    print(value)
```

### Context Managers

Context managers are used to manage resources like file streams.

```python
# Context Manager Example
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
```
