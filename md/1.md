# Building an HTTP Server in C: A Step-by-Step Guide

Are you interested in learning how to create an HTTP server from scratch using pure C? In this blog post, we'll walk through the process of building a simple HTTP server that can handle incoming requests and serve static content. By the end of this guide, you'll have a basic understanding of how web servers work and how to implement one in C.

## HTTP flow

When a client wants to communicate with a server, either the final server or an intermediate proxy, it performs the following steps:

### 1. Open a TCP connection: 

The TCP connection is used to send a request, or several, and receive an answer. The client may open a new connection, reuse an existing connection, or open several TCP connections to the servers.

### 2. Send an HTTP message, such as: 

```
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: www.google.com
Accept-Language: en
```

### 3. Read the response sent by the server, such as:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Sat, 09 Oct 2023 22:18:12 GMT
Server: Apache
Last-Modified: Fri, 01 Dec 2022 21:12:22 GMT
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Content-Length: 22729
Content-Type: text/html

<!DOCTYPE html>â€¦ (here come the 22729 bytes of the requested web page)
```

### 4. Close or reuse the connection for further requests.

If HTTP pipelining is activated, several requests can be sent without waiting for the first response to be fully received.

## RAW HTTP PACKET

In HTTP/1.1 and earlier versions, HTTP messages are easy for humans to read. But in HTTP/2, these messages are transformed into a binary structure called a frame. This change allows for optimizations like compressing headers and handling multiple requests at once. Even though only parts of the original HTTP message are sent in HTTP/2, the meaning of each message stays the same. The client then reconstructs the original HTTP/1.1 request. So, understanding HTTP/2 messages in the HTTP/1.1 format can be helpful.

There are two types of HTTP messages, requests and responses, each with its own format.

### Requests

An example HTTP request:

Requests have the following elements:

- An HTTP method, usually a like GET, POST, OPTIONS or HEAD that defines the operation the client wants to perform. Typically, a client wants to fetch a resource (using GET) or post the value of an HTML form (using POST), though more operations may be needed in other cases.
- The path of the resource to fetch; the URL of the resource stripped from elements that are obvious from the context, for example without the protocol (http://), the domain (here, www.google.com), or the TCP port (here, 80).
- The version of the HTTP protocol.
- Optional headers that convey additional information for the servers.
- A body, for some methods like POST, similar to those in responses, which contain the resource sent.

### Responses

An example response:

Responses consist of the following elements:

- The version of the HTTP protocol they follow.
- A status code, indicating if the request was successful or not, and why.
- A status message, a non-authoritative short description of the status code.
- HTTP headers, like those for requests.
- Optionally, a body containing the fetched resource.

## Writing the HTTP Server Code

Now, let's start writing the code for our HTTP server. We'll create a basic server that listens for incoming connections, accepts HTTP requests, and sends back a simple response. Here's a high-level overview of the steps involved:

- Create a socket to listen for incoming connections.
- Bind the socket to a specific port on the local machine.
- Listen for incoming connections on the bound port.
- Accept incoming connections from clients.
- Receive HTTP requests from clients.
- Parse the requests and extract relevant information.
- Generate appropriate HTTP responses.
- Send the responses back to the clients.

### Basic Example
for windows
```c
//gcc test.c  -lws2_32 && ./a.exe

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

#ifdef _WIN32
    #include <winsock2.h>
    #include <ws2tcpip.h> // Include ws2tcpip.h for inet_ntop
#else
    // TODO: Add support for Unix
#endif

#pragma comment(lib, "ws2_32.lib") // Link with ws2_32.lib

#define PORT 8000
#define BUFFER_SIZE 1024

int main() {
    WSADATA wsa;
    SOCKET server_sock, client_sock;
    struct sockaddr_in server, client;
    int client_len;
    char client_ip[INET_ADDRSTRLEN]; // Buffer to store client IP address
    char buffer[BUFFER_SIZE+1]; // Buffer to store received data

    // Initialize Winsock
    if (WSAStartup(MAKEWORD(2, 2), &wsa) != 0) {
        printf("WSAStartup failed\n");
        return 1;
    }

    // Create socket
    if ((server_sock = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0)) == INVALID_SOCKET) {
        printf("Socket creation failed\n");
        return 1;
    }

    // Prepare the sockaddr_in structure
    server.sin_family = AF_INET;
    server.sin_addr.s_addr = INADDR_ANY;
    server.sin_port = htons(PORT);
    
    // Bind
    if (bind(server_sock, (struct sockaddr *)&server, sizeof(server)) == SOCKET_ERROR) {
        printf("Bind failed\n");
        return 1;
    }
    printf("Server listening on port %d...\n", PORT);

    // Listen
    listen(server_sock, 3);

    // Accept and handle connections
    while (1) {
        client_len = sizeof(client);
        client_sock = accept(server_sock, (struct sockaddr *)&client, &client_len);
        if (client_sock == INVALID_SOCKET) {
            printf("Accept failed\n");
            return 1;
        }

        // Print client address
        inet_ntop(AF_INET, &client.sin_addr, client_ip, INET_ADDRSTRLEN);
        printf("Client connected from: %s:%d\n", client_ip, ntohs(client.sin_port));
        
        // Receive request header from client
        while (1) {
            int bytes_received = recv(client_sock, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, 0);
            if (bytes_received <= 0) break;
            buffer[bytes_received] = '\0'; // Null-terminate the received data
            printf("Received: %d\n", bytes_received);
            printf("%s\n", buffer);
            
            // Check for end of HTTP request
            if (strstr(buffer, "\r\n\r\n")) break;
        }
        char response[] = "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\nContent-Type: text/html\r\n\r\n<html><body><h1>Hello, World!</h1></body></html>";
        
        // Send response
        send(client_sock, response, strlen(response), 0);
        
        // Close client socket
        closesocket(client_sock);
    }

    // Close server socket
    closesocket(server_sock);
    WSACleanup();
    return 0;
}
```

output
`gcc l.c  -lws2_32 && ./a.exe`
